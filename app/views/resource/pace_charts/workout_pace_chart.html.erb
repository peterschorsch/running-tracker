<p>Underneath the marathon times, I listed comparable race times at the 1/2 marathon, 10 mile, 10k and 5k distances. As an example, running a 3:00:00 marathon is equivalent to running a half marathon in 1:25:20, a 10 mile race in 1:04:20, a 10k race in 38:20, and a 5k race in 18:30. They are all	
equivalent performances.</p>
<p>In the "Target Interval Pace" table, I listed the paces that you should be running during the track workouts for the various interval distances that we'll be running, based on your target race time. As an example, if your marathon goal is to run 3:00:00, then you should run approximately 1:23 for any 400m intervals that we do, 2:07 for 600m intervals, 2:53 for 800m intervals, 3:41 for 1000m intervals, 4:27 for 1200m intervals, and 6:00 for 1600m intervals. If you're training for a race like the Army 10 Mile as opposed to a marathon, and your goal is to run 10 miles in 1:15:00, pick the column that has the	closest 10 mile equivalent performance (in this case the 3:30:00 marathon column) and use the target interval times in that column as your guide. Please note that all target times are approximations and are intended to serve as guidelines for you. You will not always be hitting these times on the nose, but you should try to stay within a few seconds of them (+/- 3% would be a reasonable variation).</p>
